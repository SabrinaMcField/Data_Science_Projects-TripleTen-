# 🎬 Sentiment Decoded: Predicting Movie Review Polarity with Text Classification

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify IMDb movie reviews as **positive or negative**. Built for the Film Junky Union, the goal was to automate review moderation by detecting negative sentiment with a high level of accuracy.

## 📌 Objective

Train and evaluate machine learning models to classify sentiment based on review text, targeting a minimum F1-score of **0.85**.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Preprocessing: punctuation removal, lemmatization, and stop word filtering
- Feature Engineering: vectorization with **TF-IDF**
- Modeling: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Dummy Classifier (baseline)
- Evaluation: Precision, Recall, and F1-score with emphasis on balanced accuracy

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python, pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn, NLTK
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Jupyter Notebook

## ✅ Outcome

Achieved an F1-score exceeding 0.85, successfully meeting the project’s performance target for sentiment classification.
