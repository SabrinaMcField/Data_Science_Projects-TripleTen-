# 🖼 Face Value: Age Verification with Computer Vision

This project applies computer vision techniques to estimate a person’s age from a photograph. Built for a supermarket chain aiming to automate age verification at self-checkouts, it demonstrates how deep learning can support real-world compliance with underage alcohol sales laws.

## 📌 Objective

Build a model capable of accurately estimating age from facial images to support retail checkout policies.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Data Cleaning: removed noise and formatted image inputs
- Exploratory Data Analysis: age distributions and outlier detection
- Deep Learning: Trained CNN model using **TensorFlow/Keras**
- Evaluation: Compared MAE (mean absolute error) and visualized predictions

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python, TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (GPU environment)

## ✅ Outcome

Successfully built a deep learning model that estimates user age from facial images with reasonable accuracy, demonstrating the potential for retail use.
