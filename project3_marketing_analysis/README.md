#  Online Game Store Marketing Analysis: Data-Driven Insights for Global Strategy

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes historical sales and review data from Ice, a global online video game retailer, to uncover which platforms, genres, and games are most profitable. The analysis aims to inform the companyâ€™s 2017 marketing strategy by identifying high-performing products and regional consumer preferences.

##  Objective
The goal was to forecast which game genres and platforms are likely to perform best in the global marketplace. By analyzing trends in sales, platform life cycles, regional preferences, and review scores, the project supports data-informed business decisions in the gaming industry.

##  What Was Done (Methodology & Techniques)

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
  - Removed placeholder values (e.g., "TBD") in review columns.
  - Handled missing values in `year_of_release`, `user_score`, `critic_score`, and `rating`.
  - Converted data types and standardized column names.

- **Platform Lifecycle Analysis**:
  - Evaluated sales trends over time to identify the life span of popular platforms like PS3, X360, Wii, PS4, and XOne.
  - Found that platforms typically have ~10-year lifespans.

- **Genre Performance Evaluation**:
  - Identified Action, Sports, and Shooter as top global genres.
  - Puzzle, Fighting, and Strategy showed lower performance due to limited replay value.

- **Regional Sales Segmentation**:
  - North America: prefers Action, Shooter, Sports (dominant sales region).
  - Europe: similar preferences with additional interest in Racing games.
  - Japan: favors RPGs and handheld platforms like DS.

- **Review Score Impact**:
  - Critic scores had a strong positive correlation with sales.
  - User scores had a weaker correlation, suggesting critic reviews are more predictive of commercial success.

##  Visual Example

**Platform Lifecycle Trends**

> *Figure: A vertical bar chart showing annual sales of the top 5 gaming platforms (DS, PS2, PS3, Wii, X360) from 1998 to 2016. The plot reveals that each platform experiences a distinct rise, peak, and decline patternâ€”highlighting typical 8â€“10 year life cycles that are crucial for forecasting product demand.*

**Genre Sales by Region**

> *Figure: A grouped bar chart comparing game genre popularity across North America, Europe, and Japan. The Action and Shooter genres dominate in NA and EU, while Role-Playing Games (RPGs) are significantly more popular in Japan. These insights inform regional marketing and genre-specific investment strategies.*

**Critic Score vs. Global Sales**
