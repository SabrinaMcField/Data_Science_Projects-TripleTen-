# Data_Science_Projects_TripleTen by Sabrina McField

Welcome to my data science project portfolio! This repository showcases three end-to-end projects that demonstrate my ability to explore data, engineer features, apply predictive models, and derive actionable insights. Each project addresses real-world business problems in marketing, customer analytics, and forecasting.
