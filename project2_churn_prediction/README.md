This project analyzes telecom customer data to identify users likely to churn and uncover the factors influencing their decision. It combines exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to support proactive retention strategies.

## Key Features
- Cleaned and standardized customer data across multiple tables
- Engineered features such as contract type, tenure, and monthly charges
- Labeled churn using contract end dates and created a binary target variable
- Trained classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and LightGBM
- Evaluated model performance using AUC-ROC score and accuracy

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
